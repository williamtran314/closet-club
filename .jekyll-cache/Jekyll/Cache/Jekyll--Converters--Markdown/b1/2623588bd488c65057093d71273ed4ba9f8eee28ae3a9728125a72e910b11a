I"`<p>wuddup guys, still building out this website so i figured i should post more content. i think a lot of people are too scared to talk about gear; it should be all about the <em>music</em> after all right? however, i think the type of gear you choose as a DJ informs your style quite a bit. are you a scratch monster on a clapped-out rane with an innofader you installed yourself? are you a house junkie on some 1200s with a rotary mixer that cost the same as a used corolla? whole tribes of like-minded DJs have formed around shared interests in gear, so i think its fun to talk about it!
