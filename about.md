closet club is an idea that hatched right at the end of my last year of college at uc santa barbara. inspired by iconic online stations like NTS and hoer berlin, i wanted to put together my own semi-regular show with programming that featured my friends and their talents. i crammed my cdjs into my closet-sized bedroom, set up a webcam, and here we are! although we're not based in the "original" closet anymore, the club continues forward.

see y'all in st. louis!
